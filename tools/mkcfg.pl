=head1  NAME

mkcfg

=head1  SYNOPSIS

=over

=item mkcfg -h, --help

=back

=head1  DESCRIPTION

The mkcfg command appends the module deploy.cfg file in the module
top level directory to the deployment.cfg file in the deployment top
level directory directory.

The deployment directory is specified by the $TARGET environment variable.

If neither file exists, then an empty deployment.cfg file is created.

If deploy.cfg exists but not deployment.cfg, then a deployment.cfg
is created that contains the contents of deploy.cfg.

If deployment.cfg exists but not deploy.cfg, then deployment.cfg
remains unchanged, but due to the write a new timestamp on the file
will occur.

If both files exist, a merge of the files will be attempted, and
as long as there are no conflicts between the values of a given key
in a given block the merge will succeed and a new deployment.cfg file
will be written.

If both files exist and there is a conflict between the values of
a given key in a given block, the program will issue a warning and
keep the global setting.

No order is assumed on the blocks in the output file.

If the deployment.cfg exists, under all cases a deployment.cfg.bak
file will be created as a backup.
